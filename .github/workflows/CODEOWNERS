# Each line represents a rule, followed by a list of members.
# These members are the default owners for all files that match the specified pattern.
# The pattern generally follows the same syntax used for .gitignore files.
# The last matching rule always wins; those that appear lower in the file take precedence over rules that appear higher up.
# Specify owners by their username, email, or role assignment in the project.

# Examples:

# Member with username "Travis.Wickett" and member with email "rachel.pardey@somemail.com"
# own any JavaScript file in the repository
# *.js Travis.Wickett rachel.pardey@somemail.com

# Jake handles Gradle files
# *.gradle Jake.Miller

# Andrew owns all files under "/web/assets" directory at the repository root and all its subdirectories
# /web/assets/ Andrew.Nelson

# All members who are assigned the Project Collaborator role own any file under docs/ directory
# anywhere in the repository, but not further nested files
# docs/* "Project Collaborator"

# This file itself is owned by members who are assigned the Project Admin role in this project.
